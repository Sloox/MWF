# MWF
A C++ Framework for working with opengl shaders.
It is built via codeblocks http://www.codeblocks.org/
The exe & dlls have been included for the windows platform.
It relies heavily on GLUT.
It was developed for experimentation with opengl shaders after some insperation from the likes of ShaderToy. It was refactor for a simple Mandlebrot project for my University.
