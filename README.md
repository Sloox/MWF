# MWF
A small application to generate the mandelbrot set and display it on the screen in realtime on the GPU.
It is built via codeblocks http://www.codeblocks.org/
The exe & dlls have been included for the windows platform.
It relies heavily on GLUT.
It was developed for experimentation with opengl shaders after some insperation from the likes of ShaderToy. It was refactor for a simple Mandlebrot project for my University.
